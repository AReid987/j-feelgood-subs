## 4. Visual Style Guide Prompt - J. Feelgood Subscriptions

Here is a comprehensive visual style guide for J. Feelgood's landing pages, designed to convey **Uplifting & Joyful, Artistic & Creative, Simple & Accessible, and Trustworthy & Reliable** attributes while optimizing for conversion.

### 1. Color Palette

The color palette is chosen to evoke feelings of joy, optimism, and creativity, while maintaining a clean and modern aesthetic.

- **Primary Color:** `#FFD700` (Gold / Bright Yellow)

    - *Rationale:* Represents sunshine, happiness, optimism, and creativity. Used for dominant elements that require attention but aren't CTAs (e.g., hero section backgrounds, major section dividers, certain headings).

- **Secondary Color:** `#ADD8E6` (Light Blue / Sky Blue)

    - *Rationale:* Evokes calmness, serenity, and reliability. Used for secondary backgrounds, softer accents, or complementary elements that provide ample whitespace and readability.

- **Accent Color for CTAs:** `#FF6347` (Tomato Red / Coral)

    - *Rationale:* A vibrant, high-contrast color that stands out powerfully to drive action and create urgency. It pops against the primary and secondary colors without clashing, indicating excitement and warmth.

- **Neutral Colors (for text, backgrounds):**

    - **Dark Text:** `#333333` (Deep Charcoal Grey) - Highly readable, softer than pure black.

    - **Light Text/Backgrounds:** `#FFFFFF` (Pure White) - For abundant whitespace and clean layouts.

    - **Subtle Grey:** `#F5F5F5` (Very Light Grey) - For subtle section breaks or background textures.

### 2. Typography Recommendations

Sans-serif typography is chosen for its modern, clean, and highly readable qualities across all devices.

- **Headings (H1, H2):** **Poppins** (Bold weights, e.g., 700, 800)

    - *Rationale:* Modern, friendly, and impactful. Excellent readability at large sizes, conveying a joyful yet professional tone.

    - *Usage:* H1 for the main hero headline. H2 for major section titles.

- **Subheadings (H3, H4):** **Lato** (Semi-bold or Regular weights, e.g., 600, 400)

    - *Rationale:* Clean, highly legible, and pairs well with Poppins. Provides good visual hierarchy.

    - *Usage:* Sub-headlines, intro text for sections, and FAQ questions.

- **Body Text & Labels:** **Lato** (Regular weight, e.g., 400)

    - *Rationale:* Optimized for long-form readability, ensuring a comfortable reading experience for benefits and detailed descriptions.

    - *Usage:* Benefit descriptions, problem/agitation copy, FAQ answers, trust signals.

### 3. Button Styles and Hover States

Buttons are designed for clarity, prominence, and a "tappable" feel, using the accent color for CTAs.

- **Primary CTA Button:**

    - **Background:** `#FF6347` (Tomato Red / Coral)

    - **Text:** `#FFFFFF` (Pure White)

    - **Border:** None or `1px solid #FF6347` (subtle matching border)

    - **Font:** Poppins, 600 weight, appropriate size (e.g., 18px-22px depending on context).

    - **Border Radius:** 8px - 12px (slightly rounded for a softer, more inviting feel).

    - **Hover State:** Background slightly darker `#E65A3D` or `box-shadow` effect for subtle lift. Text color remains white.

- **Secondary CTA Button (e.g., "Learn More", "See Our Art Gallery"):**

    - **Background:** Transparent or `#ADD8E6` (Light Blue)

    - **Text:** `#333333` (Deep Charcoal Grey) or `#FF6347` (Accent color for consistency)

    - **Border:** `1px solid #ADD8E6` or `1px solid #FF6347`

    - **Font:** Lato, 500 weight.

    - **Border Radius:** Matches primary CTA (8px-12px).

    - **Hover State:** Background fills with a soft light blue or primary color, text color changes to white, or border color slightly darkens.

### 4. Whitespace and Spacing Principles

Abundant whitespace is crucial for a clean, minimalist design that enhances readability and focuses attention.

- **Generous Margins & Padding:** Ample space around sections, content blocks, and individual elements.

- **Line Height:** For body text, `1.5` to `1.7` times the font size for comfortable reading.

- **Paragraph Spacing:** Slightly more space between paragraphs than between lines within a paragraph to aid scanning.

- **Visual Grouping:** Use proximity (less space between related items) and whitespace (more space between unrelated items) to create clear visual groups and hierarchy.

- **Rule of Thumb:** Design with at least 20-30% of the screen as whitespace.

### 5. Image and Icon Guidance

Visuals are key to conveying the "feelgood" and artistic nature of the product.

- **Image Style:**

    - **High-Quality & Vibrant:** All images of art prints or unboxing experiences must be high-resolution, sharp, and showcase vibrant, "feelgood" colors.

    - **Authentic & Relatable:** Avoid overly staged stock photos. Aim for a genuine, inviting feel. Photos of prints in real (but aesthetically pleasing) environments.

    - **Consistent Filtering/Tone:** Apply a consistent, bright, and slightly warm filter to all imagery to reinforce the "uplifting" attribute.

- **Icon Style:**

    - **Line-Art or Flat Design:** Simple, clean, modern line-art or flat-design icons.

    - **Color:** Use the accent color (`#FF6347`) for key benefit icons to draw attention, or a neutral dark grey (`#333333`) for less prominent icons, on a light background.

    - **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent stroke weight and style across all icons.

- **Usage:**

    - Hero section: Engaging GIF/video of art.

    - Solution section: Collage/grid of diverse art examples.

    - Social Proof: Authentic customer photos (if available).

### 6. Mobile Optimization Principles

A mobile-first approach is non-negotiable to ensure a seamless experience on smaller screens.

- **Fluid Grids & Flexible Images:** Design components to scale smoothly across different screen sizes. Images should scale to fit their containers.

- **Single-Column Layout:** Default to a single-column layout on mobile to simplify scrolling and content consumption.

- **Touch Target Size:** Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, links) are large enough to be easily tapped (minimum 48x48px recommended).

- **Concise Content:** On mobile, content needs to be even more concise and scannable. Use shorter paragraphs and bullet points.

- **Fast Loading Times:** Optimize images and code to ensure rapid loading on mobile networks.

- **Accordion Menus:** Utilize for FAQs to save vertical space.

### 7. Layout and Grid System

A simple, responsive grid system ensures consistency and structure.

- **Fluid 12-Column Grid:** A standard 12-column grid system is flexible and widely supported by CSS frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap).

- **Breakpoints:** Define clear breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile (e.g., `1200px` for desktop, `768px` for tablet, `320px` for mobile).

- **Content Centering:** Main content blocks should be horizontally centered with a maximum width (e.g., 960px - 1140px on desktop) for optimal readability.

- **Consistent Spacing Units:** Use a consistent spacing scale (e.g., based on rem or em units, or multiples of 4px/8px) for margins, padding, and gaps between elements to maintain visual harmony.

- **Clear Visual Hierarchy:** Use size, color, contrast, and whitespace to guide the user's eye from the most important elements (headlines, CTAs) to less critical details.
