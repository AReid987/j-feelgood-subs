## 7. Mockup Template - J. Feelgood Subscriptions Landing Page Mockup

Here is a full, detailed mockup of the J. Feelgood Subscriptions landing page, meticulously designed according to the optimized structure and visual style guide.

---

### **Overall Design Principles Applied:**

- **Clean, Minimalist Design:** Abundant whitespace, focusing attention on key messages and visuals.

- **Strong Visual Hierarchy:** Clear progression from headlines to details, guiding the user's eye.

- **Ample Whitespace:** Enhances readability and gives a premium, uncluttered feel.

- **Strategic Use of Color:** Primary/secondary colors for branding and background, accent color for high-impact CTAs.

- **Mobile-First Approach:** Layout described implicitly accounts for responsive scaling to single-column on smaller screens.

- **Consistent Visual Language:** Harmonized fonts, button styles, and image tones throughout.

---

### **Section 1: Hero Section (Above the Fold)**

- **Visual Layout Description:**

    - Full-width header at the very top.

    - Hero section spans full screen width, taking up the majority of the initial viewport height.

    - Content is centrally aligned, with the primary visual (GIF/video) on one side (e.g., right on desktop, top on mobile) and text content on the other (e.g., left on desktop, below visual on mobile).

    - Ample padding around all elements for breathability.

- **Text Content (Formatted):**

    - **Headline (H1, Poppins Bold, #333333):** Unlock Daily Joy. Collect Monthly Art.

    - **Sub-headline (Lato Semi-bold, #333333):** Get a unique 'feelgood' art trading card delivered to your door every month. Just $12. No long-term commitment.

    - **Welcome Message (Lato Regular, #333333, slightly smaller than sub-headline):** Welcome to J. Feelgood Subscriptions – your consistent source of happiness. We curate high-quality, uplifting art, delivered to brighten your day, every month.

    - **Key Benefit Bullets (Lato Regular, #333333):**

        - (Icon: Sun) **Instant Mood Boost:** Consistently uplift your spirit with art that makes you smile.

    - **Subtle Trust Signal (Lato Regular, smaller font, #333333):** Join a community already rediscovering daily joy through art.

- **Descriptions of Images, Icons, or Other Visual Elements:**

    - **Header:** Small, elegant "J. Feelgood" logo (stylized, perhaps with a subtle sparkle icon integrated) in `#333333`. No navigation links, possibly a very small "Login" text link on the far right.

    - **Hero Background:** Soft, inviting gradient from `#FFD700` (Primary Color) to `#ADD8E6` (Secondary Color), or a clean `#ADD8E6` background.

    - **Visual Element (GIF/Video):** A ~15-30s looping GIF or video thumbnail on the right side (desktop) or top (mobile). Content shows:

        1. Dynamic, quick close-ups of 3-5 distinct J. Feelgood art prints (vibrant, "feelgood" style).

        2. A hand gently sliding a print from a branded J. Feelgood envelope.

        3. The print being placed into a small, elegant display stand or a collection binder with other prints. *All visuals maintain a bright, slightly warm, uplifting filter.*

    - **Icons for Bullets:** Simple, line-art or flat-design icons in `#FF6347` (Accent Color).
