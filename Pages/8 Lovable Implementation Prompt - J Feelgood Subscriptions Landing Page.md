## 8. Lovable Implementation Prompt - J. Feelgood Subscriptions Landing Page

I'd like you to build a landing page based on the following structure and copy. Please apply a clean, modern design style that follows these principles:

- **Minimalist aesthetic with ample whitespace**

- **Primary color:** `#FFD700`

- **Secondary color:** `#ADD8E6`

- **Accent color for CTAs:** `#FF6347`

- **Sans-serif typography for readability**

- **Mobile-first responsive design**

- **Clear visual hierarchy to guide the user journey**

Here's the landing page structure:

### **1. Hero Section (Above the Fold)**

- **Header:** Minimal header with "J. Feelgood" logo (stylized, perhaps with a subtle sparkle icon integrated) in `#333333`. No main navigation, possibly a very small "Login" text link on the far right.

- **Background:** Soft, inviting gradient from `#FFD700` (Primary Color) to `#ADD8E6` (Secondary Color), or a clean `#ADD8E6` background.

- **Headline (H1):** Unlock Daily Joy. Collect Monthly Art.

- **Sub-headline/Short Paragraph:** Get a unique 'feelgood' art trading card delivered to your door every month. Just $12. No long-term commitment.

- **Welcome Message:** Welcome to J. Feelgood Subscriptions – your consistent source of happiness. We curate high-quality, uplifting art, delivered to brighten your day, every month.

- **Visual:** Short (~15-30s) looping GIF or video thumbnail on the right side (desktop) or top (mobile). Content shows: 1. Dynamic, quick close-ups of 3-5 distinct J. Feelgood art prints (vibrant, "feelgood" style). 2. A hand gently sliding a print from a branded J. Feelgood envelope. 3. The print being placed into a small, elegant display stand or a collection binder with other prints. *All visuals maintain a bright, slightly warm, uplifting filter.*
