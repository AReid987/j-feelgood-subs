# Story 3.1: Secure Payment Information Submission
## Status: Draft
## Story
* As a potential subscriber,
* I want to securely provide my payment information,
* so that I can complete my monthly subscription.
## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)
* A secure payment form is integrated into the sign-up flow, appearing after user registration/login.
* The payment form collects necessary credit card details (e.g., card number, expiration date, CVC).
* The form leverages Stripe Elements (Stripe.js) for secure, client-side tokenization of payment information.
* The system supports recurring monthly payments of $12 as defined in the PRD.
* Payment information is handled in compliance with security standards (PCI DSS is abstracted by Stripe.js, but backend must handle token securely).
* Upon successful payment information submission, a payment method ID is securely sent to the backend.
* Users receive immediate confirmation upon successful subscription initiation.
* Appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid payment information or failed payment method tokenization.
* Backend API endpoint `POST /api/v1/subscriptions/subscribe` is used to create the subscription.
## Tasks / Subtasks
* [ ] Task 3.1.1: Integrate Stripe.js and Stripe Elements into the frontend application.
    * [ ] Subtask 3.1.1.1: Set up the Stripe Provider in the Next.js application.
    * [ ] Subtask 3.1.1.2: Create a Payment Form component that uses Stripe Elements (e.g., CardElement). (AC: 1, 2, 3)
* [ ] Task 3.1.2: Implement client-side logic to tokenize payment information using Stripe.js when the form is submitted. (AC: 3)
* [ ] Task 3.1.3: Develop the frontend service (`frontend/src/services/subscriptionService.ts`) to send the Payment Method ID to the backend. (AC: 6)
* [ ] Task 3.1.4: Implement the `POST /api/v1/subscriptions/subscribe` endpoint in the backend (`backend/src/api/subscriptions.py`).
    * [ ] Subtask 3.1.4.1: Receive Payment Method ID and associate it with the authenticated user.
    * [ ] Subtask 3.1.4.2: Use Stripe SDK to create a customer (if not already existing, using `stripe_customer_id` from `User` model).
    * [ ] Subtask 3.1.4.3: Use Stripe SDK to create a recurring subscription for the $12/month product using the customer and payment method IDs.
    * [ ] Subtask 3.1.4.4: Update the `users` table with the `stripe_customer_id` and `current_subscription_id`.
    * [ ] Subtask 3.1.4.5: Store the `Subscription` record in the local PostgreSQL database, mirroring Stripe's status.
* [ ] Task 3.1.5: Handle successful subscription initiation on the frontend, displaying confirmation to the user. (AC: 7)
* [ ] Task 3.1.6: Implement error handling for payment failures (e.g., invalid card, insufficient funds) and display appropriate messages on the frontend. (AC: 8)
## Dev Technical Guidance
* **Stripe Integration:** Strictly follow Stripe's official documentation for integrating Stripe Elements and handling Payment Methods. Prioritize client-side tokenization to minimize PCI compliance burden on your backend.
* **Backend Payment Processing:** The backend's `POST /api/v1/subscriptions/subscribe` endpoint is critical. It must securely interact with the Stripe API to create customers and subscriptions. Refer to `docs/architecture.md#api-reference` for Stripe API details.
* **Data Models:** Ensure the `User` and `Subscription` data models in the database (`docs/architecture.md#data-models`) are correctly updated with Stripe customer and subscription IDs.
* **Frontend-Backend Communication:** Ensure the frontend sends only the securely tokenized `payment_method_id` to the backend, not raw card details. Authenticate the subscription request using the user's JWT.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for both Stripe API calls and database operations. Display user-friendly error messages, avoiding sensitive payment information leakage.
## Story Progress Notes
### Agent Model Used: Benjamin "Beacon" Hayes (Product Owner)
### Completion Notes List
* This story enables users to make initial payments, which is essential for the service's monetization.
* Focuses on secure integration with Stripe for payment processing.
