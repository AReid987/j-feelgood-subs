## **Document 12: Story 3.2: Automated Recurring Payment Processing**


```markdown
# Story 3.2: Automated Recurring Payment Processing
## Status: Draft
## Story
* As a system,
* I want to automatically process recurring monthly payments,
* so that subscribers are billed correctly.
## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)
* Monthly billing cycles are automated for active subscriptions.
* The system is capable of initiating charges against stored payment methods via Stripe.
* Failed payments are handled with appropriate notifications to the user (e.g., email notification for payment failure) and internal system alerts (e.g., logging).
* The payment processing system is reliable and handles retry logic for failed payments as per Stripe's default behavior or defined custom logic.
* Subscription status in the local PostgreSQL database is synchronized with Stripe's status (e.g., `active`, `past_due`, `cancelled`).
* The backend includes mechanisms to listen for and process Stripe webhooks (e.g., `invoice.payment_succeeded`, `invoice.payment_failed`, `customer.subscription.deleted`).
* The system ensures that only active subscriptions trigger recurring payments.
## Tasks / Subtasks
* [ ] Task 3.2.1: Implement backend logic for handling Stripe webhooks (`backend/src/api/webhooks.py`).
    * [ ] Subtask 3.2.1.1: Set up a dedicated endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/v1/stripe-webhooks`) to receive Stripe events.
    * [ ] Subtask 3.2.1.2: Implement webhook signature verification to ensure requests are from Stripe.
    * [ ] Subtask 3.2.1.3: Parse and process key webhook events (e.g., `invoice.payment_succeeded`, `invoice.payment_failed`, `customer.subscription.updated`).
* [ ] Task 3.2.2: Update `Subscription` records in the local PostgreSQL database based on Stripe webhook events. (AC: 5)
    * [ ] Subtask 3.2.2.1: Implement logic to update `status`, `current_period_end`, and `end_date` (if cancelled) in the `subscriptions` table.
    * [ ] Subtask 3.2.2.2: Update `subscription_status` on the `users` table based on the subscription status.
* [ ] Task 3.2.3: Implement user notification logic for payment failures. (AC: 3)
    * [ ] Subtask 3.2.3.1: Draft an email template for payment failure.
    * [ ] Subtask 3.2.3.2: Integrate an email sending service (e.g., AWS SES or a similar provider) if not already.
    * [ ] Subtask 3.2.3.3: Trigger email notification upon `invoice.payment_failed` webhook event.
* [ ] Task 3.2.4: Implement internal logging/alerting for payment failures and other critical webhook events. (AC: 3)
* [ ] Task 3.2.5: (Implicit by Stripe) Verify Stripe's default retry logic and dunning settings are appropriate for the service. (AC: 4)
## Dev Technical Guidance
* **Stripe Webhooks:** This is a critical component for backend-Stripe synchronization. Ensure strict adherence to Stripe's webhook best practices, including signature verification and idempotent processing of events. Refer to Stripe's official documentation for detailed implementation.
* **Database Synchronization:** The backend logic must ensure the local `users` and `subscriptions` tables remain synchronized with Stripe's actual subscription status. This is vital for accurate subscription management and billing.
* **Asynchronous Processing:** Webhook handling should be fast. For complex tasks (like sending emails), consider offloading to a background job queue to avoid timeouts.
* **Error Handling & Logging:** Implement comprehensive error handling and logging for webhook processing to detect and diagnose issues with payment updates. Log sensitive events securely.
* **Email Notifications:** Integrate a reliable email service (e.g., AWS SES or similar) and ensure email templates are clear and concise.
## Story Progress Notes
### Agent Model Used: Benjamin "Beacon" Hayes (Product Owner)
### Completion Notes List
* This story addresses the automated, ongoing billing process for subscribers.
* Focuses heavily on backend integration with Stripe's webhook system to maintain data consistency.
* Includes basic notification for payment failures.
