# Story 4.1: Exclusive Bonus Content Access
## Status: Draft
## Story
* As a subscriber,
* I want access to exclusive bonus content,
* so that I can learn more about the art and artists.
## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)
* A dedicated section or page for "Exclusive Content" is accessible within the Subscription Management Dashboard for authenticated subscribers.
* This section displays bonus content such as artist interviews and behind-the-scenes stories.
* Only authenticated subscribers can view this exclusive content.
* The exclusive content is clearly differentiated from publicly available content on the landing page.
* The frontend fetches exclusive content from a new backend API endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/v1/exclusive-content`).
* The backend securely serves exclusive content only to authorized subscribers.
* If no exclusive content is available, a message indicating this is displayed gracefully.
## Tasks / Subtasks
* [ ] Task 4.1.1: Design and implement the "Exclusive Content" section or page in the frontend (`frontend/src/app/dashboard/exclusive-content/page.tsx`). (AC: 1)
* [ ] Task 4.1.2: Implement frontend service function to fetch exclusive content from the backend API. (AC: 5)
* [ ] Task 4.1.3: Develop the `GET /api/v1/exclusive-content` endpoint in the backend (`backend/src/api/content.py`). (AC: 5)
    * [ ] Subtask 4.1.3.1: Implement authentication/authorization middleware to restrict access to subscribers only.
    * [ ] Subtask 4.1.3.2: Implement logic to retrieve exclusive content data (e.g., from a database or static files).
* [ ] Task 4.1.4: Display the fetched exclusive content on the frontend. (AC: 2)
* [ ] Task 4.1.5: Implement UI to clearly mark content as "exclusive" or "subscriber-only". (AC: 4)
* [ ] Task 4.1.6: Handle cases where no exclusive content is available. (AC: 7)
## Dev Technical Guidance
* **Frontend UI:** Create a new page or section within the dashboard using Next.js App Router. Components for displaying content should be reusable and adhere to frontend architecture guidelines.
* **Backend Content Management:** Consider how exclusive content will be stored (e.g., in a new database table, or as static files accessible only by the backend and then streamed/served).
* **Authentication/Authorization:** This endpoint *must* be protected. Ensure that only authenticated and *subscribed* users can access this content. Leverage JWT tokens for authentication and add authorization checks in the backend endpoint as per `docs/architecture.md#security-best-practices`.
* **API Design:** The `GET /api/v1/exclusive-content` endpoint should return structured data suitable for display on the frontend.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for API calls, especially for unauthorized access (e.g., displaying a "Access Denied" message).
## Story Progress Notes
### Agent Model Used: Benjamin "Beacon" Hayes (Product Owner)
### Completion Notes List

* It requires implementing a new protected API endpoint and a corresponding frontend display.
