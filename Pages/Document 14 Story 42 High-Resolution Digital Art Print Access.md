# Story 4.2: High-Resolution Digital Art Print Access
## Status: Draft
## Story
* As a subscriber,
* I want to receive a high-resolution digital copy of the art print,
* so that I can use it digitally.
## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)
* Authenticated subscribers have a method to access or download the digital copy of their monthly art print.
* The digital copies are high-resolution and suitable for digital use (e.g., wallpapers, digital frames).
* Access to digital prints is restricted to active subscribers for the corresponding month's print.
* The frontend provides a clear user interface element (e.g., a download button) for accessing digital prints within the Subscription Management Dashboard.
* The backend securely serves the digital print files, ensuring only authorized subscribers can download them.
* Digital copies are unique to the art print received for that month.
## Tasks / Subtasks
* [ ] Task 4.2.1: Enhance the Subscription Management Dashboard to display a list of received monthly prints. (AC: 1)
* [ ] Task 4.2.2: Implement a "Download Digital Print" button/link for each monthly print accessible by the subscriber. (AC: 4)
* [ ] Task 4.2.3: Implement a new backend API endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/v1/digital-prints/{print_id}/download`) to serve digital print files. (AC: 5)
    * [ ] Subtask 4.2.3.1: Implement authentication and authorization checks to ensure the user is an active subscriber and is authorized for that specific print.
    * [ ] Subtask 4.2.3.2: Configure secure file storage (e.g., AWS S3 with signed URLs) for high-resolution digital art print files.
    * [ ] Subtask 4.2.3.3: Implement logic to generate a secure, temporary download URL (e.g., pre-signed S3 URL) for the digital print.
* [ ] Task 4.2.4: Connect the frontend download button to the backend digital print download endpoint. (AC: 4)
* [ ] Task 4.2.5: Ensure digital print files are stored in an appropriate format (e.g., JPG, PNG) and resolution. (AC: 2)
## Dev Technical Guidance
* **Secure File Serving:** For digital assets, using a cloud object storage service like AWS S3 with pre-signed URLs is highly recommended. This allows secure, temporary access to private files without exposing your backend directly for file serving. Refer to `docs/architecture.md#cloud-services`.
* **Authentication/Authorization:** The digital print endpoint MUST be protected. Access must be granted only to authenticated and *active* subscribers, and specifically for the prints they are entitled to. This will involve checking subscription status and potentially associating prints with subscription periods in your database.
* **API Design:** The `GET /api/v1/digital-prints/{print_id}/download` endpoint should return the pre-signed URL (or trigger the download directly if not using pre-signed URLs, but that's less scalable).
* **Data Models:** Consider if a new `ArtPrint` or `MonthlyCollection` model needs to be extended or created to store metadata about each print and its digital file location. Refer to `docs/architecture.md#data-models`.
* **Frontend UI:** Integrate the download functionality seamlessly into the existing Subscription Management Dashboard. Ensure good user feedback during the download process (e.g., loading states).
## Story Progress Notes
### Agent Model Used: Benjamin "Beacon" Hayes (Product Owner)
### Completion Notes List
* This story adds a digital value proposition, enhancing subscriber satisfaction.
* It introduces secure file serving mechanisms for digital assets.
* Requires robust authorization to ensure content is only available to entitled subscribers.
