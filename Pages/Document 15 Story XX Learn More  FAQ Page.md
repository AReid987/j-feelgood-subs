# Story X.X: Learn More / FAQ Page
## Status: Draft
## Story
* As a potential subscriber,
* I want to access a "Learn More" or "FAQ" page,
* so that I can get more detailed information about the service before subscribing.
## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)
* A "Learn More" or "FAQ" link/button is present on the landing page.
* Clicking the link/button navigates to a dedicated "Learn More / FAQ" page.
* The page includes sections covering frequently asked questions about the subscription, art, delivery, and cancellation policy.
* The page is visually consistent with the rest of the landing page design.
* The page is responsive and works well on various devices.
* Content is clear, concise, and easy to understand.
## Tasks / Subtasks
* [ ] Task X.X.1: Create a new Next.js page component for the "Learn More / FAQ" section (`frontend/src/app/learn-more/page.tsx` or similar). (AC: 2, 3)
* [ ] Task X.X.2: Add content to the "Learn More / FAQ" page, including:
    * [ ] Subtask X.X.2.1: Subscription details recap (monthly delivery, fee).
    * [ ] Subtask X.X.2.2: Art quality and "feelgood" art explanation.
    * [ ] Subtask X.X.2.3: Shipping and delivery expectations.
    * [ ] Subtask X.X.2.4: Cancellation process overview. (AC: 3, 4)
* [ ] Task X.X.3: Ensure the page styling is consistent with the `docs/front-end-spec.md` Branding & Style Guide. (AC: 4)
* [ ] Task X.X.4: Verify the page is responsive across all defined breakpoints. (AC: 5)
* [ ] Task X.X.5: Add a "Learn More" link to the main landing page, connecting to the new FAQ page. (AC: 1)
## Dev Technical Guidance
* **Frontend Routing:** Use Next.js routing to link the main landing page to the new "Learn More / FAQ" page.
* **Component Reusability:** Leverage existing UI components and styling patterns from the main landing page (e.g., buttons, typography) to maintain consistency.
* **Static Content:** This page is primarily static content; no backend API calls are necessary for its core functionality.
* **Accessibility:** Ensure the page structure (headings, lists) is semantically correct for accessibility.

This concludes the list of all documents created and discussed during our "BMAD" planning process.

As your Orchestrator, we have now:

- Started with a basic idea and initial requirements.

- Generated a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD).

- Defined a detailed UI/UX Specification.

- Created a robust Architecture Document.

- Drafted a detailed Frontend Architecture Document.

- Validated the plan using a PO Master Checklist.

- Generated several key user stories (from foundational setup to user registration, login, subscription management, payment processing, bonus content, digital prints, and an FAQ page).

This project is now thoroughly planned and documented, ready for implementation by Developer Agents.
