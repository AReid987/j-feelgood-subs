## Document 2: JFeelgood Subscriptions PRD

# Project Requirements Document (PRD) for JFeelgood Subscriptions

## Goal, Objective and Context

The objective of this project is to design and develop a compelling landing page for a monthly art print subscription service called "JFeelgood Subscriptions". This service will deliver trading card-sized "feelgood" art prints for $12/month. The landing page should effectively communicate the value proposition to potential subscribers, provide a seamless user experience for signing up, and allow users to manage their subscriptions.

## Functional Requirements (MVP)

### Landing Page Content

1. **Service Description:** Clearly describe the monthly subscription service and highlight the delivery of unique, collectible art trading cards. Emphasize the "feelgood" nature of the art to create a positive emotional connection with potential subscribers.

2. **Visuals:** Include high-quality images or examples of the art prints to be featured.

3. **Headline & Subheading:** The landing page should feature a headline like "Brighten Your Day with Our Monthly Art Print Subscription!" and a subheading such as "Get a new, collectible 'feelgood' art trading card delivered right to your doorstep every month for just $12!".

4. **Welcome Message:** Include a welcome message, e.g., "Welcome to [Service Name], your monthly dose of positivity and art. Our mission is to spread joy through high-quality, unique 'feelgood' art prints, carefully curated and delivered to your doorstep".

5. **Subscription Details Section:** Detail monthly delivery, art quality (high-resolution prints on premium cardstock), and the subscription fee ($12/month, cancel anytime).

6. **Call to Action (CTA) Buttons:** Include "Subscribe Now" and "Learn More" buttons.

### Authentication and Payment Processing

1. **Authentication System:** Implement a secure authentication system for users to sign up or log in and manage their subscriptions.

2. **Payment Processing System:** Integrate a reliable payment processing system that supports recurring monthly subscriptions of $12.

3. **Authentication and Payment Form:** Provide a secure form for sign-up/login and for entering payment details to start the subscription.

## Non Functional Requirements (MVP)

- **Responsiveness:** The landing page should be responsive and work well on various devices.

- **Security:** The authentication and payment systems must be secure.

- **Reliability:** The payment processing system must be reliable.

## User Interaction and Design Goals

The desired look and feel is one that is "feelgood," creating a positive emotional connection with potential subscribers. The landing page should provide a seamless user experience for signing up and managing subscriptions. The primary target devices are web desktop and mobile-first responsive web app, as implied by the need for responsiveness on "various devices".

## Technical Assumptions

- **Repository & Service Architecture:** The most efficient approach for this project, given the need for a landing page with authentication and payment processing, is likely a **Monorepo** structure. This would contain both the frontend (landing page) and backend services (authentication, payment processing) within a single repository. For the high-level service architecture, a **Monolith** for initial MVP with clear internal modularity, or **Serverless functions** for specific actions (like payment webhooks), would provide rapid deployment and scalability. The decision will be further detailed by the Architect.

- **Target Devices:** Primarily web desktop, with mobile-first responsive web app considerations.

- **Authentication System:** A secure system is required.

- **Payment Gateway:** A payment gateway supporting recurring payments is necessary.

- **Scalability:** While not explicitly stated with metrics, the phrase "expected traffic volume" and "scalability requirements" in open questions implies a need to consider scaling.

- **Design Preferences:** There may be specific design preferences or brand guidelines to follow.

### Testing requirements

- **Conversion Rate Tracking:** Track the conversion rate of visitors to subscribers.

- **Subscriber Retention Rate Monitoring:** Monitor the subscriber retention rate over time.

- **Customer Satisfaction Collection:** Collect customer satisfaction ratings regarding the quality of art prints and overall service experience.

- **Acceptance Criteria Verification:** The landing page is visually appealing and effectively communicates the service's value proposition. The authentication system is secure and allows users to manage their subscriptions. The payment processing system is reliable and supports recurring monthly subscriptions. The landing page is responsive and works well on various devices.
