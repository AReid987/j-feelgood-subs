## Overall UX Goals & Principles
* **Target User Personas:**
    * Art collectors and enthusiasts.
    * Individuals seeking unique, monthly subscription services.
    * People looking for "feelgood" content to brighten their day or decorate their spaces.
* **Usability Goals:**
    * **Intuitive Navigation:** Users should easily find information about the service and how to subscribe.
    * **Effortless Onboarding:** The sign-up and subscription process should be quick and straightforward, minimizing user friction.
    * **Clear Feedback:** Provide immediate and understandable feedback for user actions, especially during authentication and payment.
* **Design Principles:**
    * **Joyful Simplicity:** The design should be clean, uncluttered, and evoke a positive, "feelgood" emotion.
    * **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent visual style and interaction patterns across all elements of the landing page and subscription management.

    * **Accessibility:** Ensure the design is usable by a broad range of users, considering various abilities.
## Information Architecture (IA)
### Site Map / Screen Inventory
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Homepage] --> B{Authentication};
    B -- Sign Up --> C[Registration Form];
    B -- Login --> D[Login Form];
    C --> E[Subscription Management Dashboard];
    D --> E;
    A -- Call to Action --> B;
    A --> F[About/FAQ];
    E --> G[Update Profile/Payment];
    E --> H[Cancel Subscription];
```

- **Homepage:** The main landing page, serving as the entry point, showcasing the service description, art visuals, subscription details, and Call to Action buttons.

- **Authentication (Sign Up/Login):** This conceptual node represents the forms required for users to create new accounts or log into existing ones.

- **Registration Form:** Specific form for new users to sign up.

- **Login Form:** Specific form for existing users to log in.

- **Subscription Management Dashboard:** A protected area where authenticated subscribers can view their current subscription status.

- **Update Profile/Payment:** Functionality within the dashboard for users to update personal or payment information.

- **Cancel Subscription:** Functionality within the dashboard allowing users to cancel their subscription.

- **About/FAQ:** An optional section for more detailed information about the service, art, and frequently asked questions.

### Navigation Structure

The primary navigation will be driven by clear Call to Action buttons on the Homepage leading to the Authentication forms ("Subscribe Now", "Learn More"). Once authenticated, a user will be redirected to their Subscription Management Dashboard. Navigation within the dashboard will allow users to access various management functionalities. An "About/FAQ" link might be present on the homepage for detailed information.

## User Flows

### User Login/Sign Up Flow

- **Goal:** For a new or returning user to gain access to their subscription management.

- **Steps / Diagram:**

Code snippet

```text
graph TD
    A[Homepage] --> B{Click Subscribe Now / Login};
    B -- New User --> C[Registration Form];
    B -- Existing User --> D[Login Form];
    C --> E[Complete Registration];
    D --> F[Submit Login Credentials];
    E --> G[Subscription Management Dashboard];
    F --> G;
    G -- If Not Subscribed --> H[Payment Information Form];
    H --> I[Subscription Confirmed];
```

### Initial Subscription Process

- **Goal:** For a new user to successfully subscribe to the monthly art print service.

- **Steps / Diagram:**

Code snippet

```text
graph TD
    A[Homepage] --> B[Click Subscribe Now];
    B --> C[Registration/Login Form];
    C -- New User Flow (as above) --> D[Payment Information Form];
    D --> E[Enter Payment Details];
    E --> F[Submit Payment];
    F -- Success --> G[Subscription Confirmed & Access Dashboard];
    F -- Failure --> H[Show Error Message & Retry Payment];
```

## Wireframes & Mockups

This section references the external design files where detailed visual designs and interactive prototypes will be maintained. No files currently exist, and their creation will be handled in a dedicated design phase using tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD.

- **Screen / View Name 1: Homepage**

    - **Description:** Primary landing page showcasing the service with engaging visuals and clear calls to action.

    - **Link to specific Figma frame/page:** To be created.

- **Screen / View Name 2: Sign Up/Login Forms**

    - **Description:** Dedicated views for user registration and existing user login, ensuring a clear and secure process.

    - **Link to specific Figma frame/page:** To be created.

- **Screen / View Name 3: Subscription Management Dashboard**

    - **Description:** A personalized view for logged-in subscribers to manage their account, view subscription status, and update details.

    - **Link to specific Figma frame/page:** To be created.

## Component Library / Design System Reference

- **Approach:** For this MVP, we will establish a foundational component library. This will allow for consistent design and development of reusable UI elements. As the project grows, this can evolve into a more comprehensive design system.

- **Initial Foundational Components (High-Level):**

    - **Buttons:** Various states (primary, secondary, disabled, loading) and sizes.

    - **Input Fields:** Text, password, email inputs with validation states.

    - **Forms:** Standardized structure for sign-up, login, and payment forms.

    - **Cards:** Used for displaying art prints and subscription details.

    - **Typography Elements:** Consistent headings, body text, and links.

    - **Icons:** Small, illustrative graphics for actions or information.

## Branding & Style Guide Reference

This section outlines the foundational visual elements to ensure a cohesive and "feelgood" brand experience. Detailed design specifications will be elaborated in external design files.

- **Color Palette:**

    - **Primary:** A vibrant, uplifting color (e.g., a warm yellow or bright teal).

    - **Secondary:** A complementary, calming color (e.g., a soft blue or light green).

    - **Accent:** A contrasting, attention-grabbing color for CTAs (e.g., an energetic orange or deep purple).

    - **Neutrals:** Soft grays and whites and whites for backgrounds and text, ensuring readability.

- **Typography:**

    - **Font Families:** A clean, legible sans-serif font for body text, potentially paired with a friendly, slightly more decorative font for headlines to convey the "feelgood" theme.

    - **Sizes & Weights:** Defined hierarchy for headings (H1, H2, H3), body text, and captions to ensure visual order and readability.

- **Iconography:**

    - **Style:** Simple, line-based or filled icons that align with the overall "feelgood" and clean aesthetic.

    - **Usage Notes:** Icons to be used for clear visual communication without clutter.

- **Spacing & Grid:**

    - **System:** A consistent 4-point or 8-point grid system to ensure harmonious spacing and alignment across all elements.

    - **Margins & Padding:** Defined spacing rules to provide adequate white space and visual breathing room.

## Accessibility (AX) Requirements

- **Target Compliance:** WCAG 2.1 AA.

- **Specific Requirements:**

    - **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields) must be fully navigable and operable using only the keyboard. Focus order should be logical and intuitive.

    - **ARIA Landmarks/Attributes:** Appropriate ARIA roles, states, and properties should be used for complex components (e.g., forms, navigation) to convey meaning to assistive technologies.

    - **Color Contrast:** All text and essential UI elements must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios to ensure readability for users with visual impairments.

    - **Alternative Text:** All meaningful images must have descriptive `alt` text.

    - **Form Labels:** All form fields must have explicit, programmatically associated labels.

## Responsiveness

The JFeelgood Subscriptions landing page and subscription management interface will be designed to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.

- **Breakpoints:**

    - **Mobile:** Up to 640px (e.g., small smartphones)

    - **Tablet:** 641px - 1024px (e.g., larger smartphones, tablets in portrait)

    - **Desktop:** 1025px and up (e.g., tablets in landscape, laptops, desktops)

- **Adaptation Strategy:**

    - **Fluid Grids:** Layouts will utilize flexible grids that resize proportionally to the screen width.

    - **Flexible Images:** Images and media will scale appropriately to fit their containers, preventing overflow.

    - **Media Queries:** CSS media queries will be used to apply different styles, layouts, and component visibility rules based on the defined breakpoints.

    - **Content Prioritization:** On smaller screens, content will be prioritized, and less critical elements may be hidden or presented differently (e.g., navigation becoming a hamburger menu).

    - **Touch-Friendly Interactions:** Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, forms) are appropriately sized and spaced for touch input on mobile devices.
