## Document 6: Story 1.2: Initial Project Scaffolding and Infrastructure Setup

# Story 1.2: Initial Project Scaffolding and Infrastructure Setup
## Status: Draft
## Story
* As a system administrator,
* I want the project scaffolding and initial infrastructure set up
* so that development can begin efficiently.
## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)
* A new project repository is initialized, adhering to the monorepo structure outlined in `docs/architecture.md`.
* Basic project structure (e.g., `frontend/`, `backend/` directories) is established as per `docs/architecture.md`.
* Initial CI/CD pipeline (conceptual) is outlined for automated deployments within the `.github/workflows/` directory, reflecting the GitHub Actions strategy.
* Local development environment setup instructions are documented in the `README.md` at the project root and in `backend/` and `frontend/` directories, specifying required tools (Node.js 22.x, Python 3.11, Docker if used for local dev) and dependency installation steps.
* Core dependencies for both frontend (Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Zustand/React Context) and backend (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, `passlib`, `python-jose`) are installed and configured as per the "Definitive Tech Stack Selections" in `docs/architecture.md`.
* Basic `Dockerfile`s are provided for containerization of the backend application for consistent environments (if chosen for deployment, or for local dev).
* Initial database setup (PostgreSQL) is planned, including connection configuration and initial schema definition for `users` and `subscriptions` tables as per `docs/architecture.md`.
* Initial `.env.example` files are created at the root, frontend, and backend directories, outlining necessary environment variables (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, database connection strings, Stripe API keys placeholders) and their secure handling.
## Tasks / Subtasks
* [ ] Task 1.2.1: Initialize new Git repository and create the root monorepo directory structure (e.g., `frontend/`, `backend/`, `docs/`, `.github/`). (AC: 1, 2)
* [ ] Task 1.2.2: Create initial `README.md` at project root with basic setup instructions and overview. (AC: 4)
* [ ] Task 1.2.3: Set up `frontend/` directory with a basic Next.js project.
    * [ ] Subtask 1.2.3.1: Install Next.js, React, TypeScript.
    * [ ] Subtask 1.2.3.2: Configure Tailwind CSS.
    * [ ] Subtask 1.2.3.3: Set up initial state management library (Zustand or React Context) boilerplate.
    * [ ] Subtask 1.2.3.4: Add initial `frontend/.env.example`.
    * [ ] Subtask 1.2.3.5: Create `frontend/README.md` with specific setup instructions. (AC: 4, 5)
* [ ] Task 1.2.4: Set up `backend/` directory with a basic FastAPI project.
    * [ ] Subtask 1.2.4.1: Install FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLAlchemy.
    * [ ] Subtask 1.2.4.2: Install `passlib` and `python-jose`.
    * [ ] Subtask 1.2.4.3: Add initial `backend/.env.example`.
    * [ ] Subtask 1.2.4.4: Create `backend/README.md` with specific setup instructions. (AC: 4, 5)
* [ ] Task 1.2.5: Create initial `Dockerfile` for the backend application. (AC: 6)
* [ ] Task 1.2.6: Draft initial `users` and `subscriptions` table schemas within `backend/src/models/` using SQLAlchemy. (AC: 7)
* [ ] Task 1.2.7: Create a basic CI/CD workflow file (e.g., `main.yml`) in `.github/workflows/` with placeholders for build/test/deploy steps. (AC: 3)
* [ ] Task 1.2.8: Create `docs/` directory and populate it with initial `index.md`, `prd.md`, `architecture.md`, `front-end-spec.md` (by copying from this session's output). (AC: 1)
## Dev Technical Guidance
* **Project Structure Adherence:** Strictly follow the monorepo layout detailed in `docs/architecture.md#project-structure`.
* **Technology Stack:** Ensure all installations and configurations align with the exact versions specified in `docs/architecture.md#definitive-tech-stack-selections`.
* **Environment Variables:** Refer to `docs/architecture.md#security-best-practices` regarding sensitive information. Use `.env.example` as templates; do not commit actual credentials.
* **Database Setup:** Focus on defining the models in the backend first; actual database provisioning/migrations can be a subsequent story but models should be ready.
* **CI/CD:** The initial CI/CD is a placeholder. Focus on structure and basic stages.
* **Local Development:** Ensure `README.md`s are clear enough for a new developer to get both frontend and backend running locally with minimal fuss.
* **Coding Standards:** Adhere to Python and TypeScript coding standards defined in `docs/architecture.md#coding-standards`.
## Story Progress Notes
### Agent Model Used: Benjamin "Beacon" Hayes (Product Owner)
### Completion Notes List
* This story provides the foundational setup required for all subsequent development.
* It includes both frontend and backend initial scaffolding within the monorepo.
* The database schema definition is a part of this story to ensure data models are in place early, even if actual database provisioning is in a separate DevOps story.
