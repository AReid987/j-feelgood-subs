# Story 1.1: Design and Content for JFeelgood Subscriptions Landing Page
## Status: Draft
## Story
* As a potential subscriber,
* I want to view a compelling landing page
* so that I can understand the service and am encouraged to subscribe.
## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)
* The landing page is visually appealing and effectively communicates the service's value proposition.
* The landing page includes high-quality images or examples of art prints.
* The landing page displays a clear headline, subheading, and welcome message.
* The landing page includes a "Subscription Details" section with information on monthly delivery, art quality, and fee.
* The landing page contains "Subscribe Now" and "Learn More" Call to Action (CTA) buttons.
* The landing page is responsive and works well on various devices.
* The design adheres to the "Joyful Simplicity" principle, being clean, uncluttered, and evoking a positive, "feelgood" emotion.
* The color palette, typography, and iconography align with the Branding & Style Guide Reference.
* All interactive elements are keyboard navigable and meet WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast ratios.
* Images have descriptive `alt` text.
* The layout adapts correctly across Mobile (up to 640px), Tablet (641px - 1024px), and Desktop (1025px+) breakpoints.
## Tasks / Subtasks
* [ ] Task 1.1.1: Implement the core HTML structure for the landing page. (AC: 1, 6)
* [ ] Task 1.1.2: Integrate the chosen styling approach (Tailwind CSS) and apply global styles as per `frontend/src/app/globals.css`. (AC: 1, 8)
* [ ] Task 1.1.3: Develop the headline and subheading sections. (AC: 3)
* [ ] Task 1.1.4: Implement the welcome message section. (AC: 3)
* [ ] Task 1.1.5: Create and populate the "Subscription Details" section with text and visual elements. (AC: 4)
* [ ] Task 1.1.6: Implement "Subscribe Now" and "Learn More" CTA buttons, ensuring they are interactive. (AC: 5)
* [ ] Task 1.1.7: Incorporate high-quality image placeholders for art prints, ensuring they are responsive and have `alt` text. (AC: 2, 9)
* [ ] Task 1.1.8: Ensure the page layout is responsive across defined breakpoints using CSS media queries. (AC: 6, 10)
* [ ] Task 1.1.9: Verify basic accessibility, including keyboard navigation and color contrast. (AC: 9)
## Dev Technical Guidance
* **Component Structure:** While this story focuses on the overall page, think about how sections could evolve into reusable components (e.g., `HeroSection`, `SubscriptionDetailsCard`).
* **Styling:** Prioritize direct Tailwind utility classes for simple cases. For complex or repeated patterns, consider proposing reusable component classes via `@apply` in `src/styles/components.css` or dedicated React components from `src/components/ui/`. Refer to `docs/front-end-architecture.md#styling-approach`.
* **Image Optimization:** Use the Next.js `<Image>` component for all images, which handles optimization, lazy loading, and responsiveness automatically.
* **Accessibility:** Pay close attention to semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for interactive elements. Review `docs/front-end-architecture.md#accessibility-ax-implementation-details`.
* **Responsiveness:** Refer to the "Responsiveness" section in `docs/front-end-spec.md` for specific breakpoints and adaptation strategies.
* **State Management:** This story is mostly static, but any future interactivity should consider `useState` for local component state as the default, only escalating to `Zustand` or `Context API` if data needs to be shared widely.

### Agent Model Used: Benjamin "Beacon" Hayes (Product Owner)
