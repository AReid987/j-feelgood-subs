## Document 8: Story 2.1: Secure User Registration

```text
# Story 2.1: Secure User Registration
## Status: Draft
## Story
* As a new user,
* I want to securely sign up for an account
* so that I can subscribe to the service.
## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)
* A secure user registration form is available on the landing page (e.g., accessible via the "Subscribe Now" CTA).
* The registration form collects necessary information (e.g., email, password).
* Users can successfully create a new account with valid credentials.
* Password policies (e.g., minimum length, complexity) are enforced during registration.
* User data is stored securely in the PostgreSQL database.
* Upon successful registration, the user is automatically authenticated and either redirected to their dashboard or prompted to proceed to payment.
* Backend API endpoint `POST /api/v1/auth/signup` is used for registration.
* Error messages are displayed for invalid or existing user credentials (e.g., email already in use).
## Tasks / Subtasks
* [ ] Task 2.1.1: Create the user registration form component in the frontend (`frontend/src/features/auth/components/SignupForm.tsx`). (AC: 1)
* [ ] Task 2.1.2: Implement client-side validation for email and password fields based on defined policies. (AC: 4)
* [ ] Task 2.1.3: Develop the frontend service (`frontend/src/services/authService.ts`) to interact with the backend authentication API. (AC: 7)
* [ ] Task 2.1.4: Implement the `POST /api/v1/auth/signup` endpoint in the backend (`backend/src/api/auth.py`). (AC: 7)
    * [ ] Subtask 2.1.4.1: Integrate `passlib` for password hashing and verification.
    * [ ] Subtask 2.1.4.2: Implement logic to check for existing users (unique email constraint).
    * [ ] Subtask 2.1.4.3: Create a new user record in the `users` table upon successful registration using SQLAlchemy.
* [ ] Task 2.1.5: Handle successful registration flow, including token generation (if applicable for immediate login) and redirection/prompt. (AC: 5)
* [ ] Task 2.1.6: Implement error handling for registration failures (e.g., invalid input, email already exists) and display appropriate messages on the frontend. (AC: 8)
## Dev Technical Guidance
* **Frontend Form:** Use a headless UI library (Radix UI / shadcn/ui) for form elements to ensure accessibility and integrate with Tailwind CSS for styling. Refer to `docs/front-end-architecture.md#component-breakdown--implementation-details`.
* **Backend Authentication:** Follow the security best practices for password hashing using `passlib` as defined in `docs/architecture.md#security-best-practices`.
* **API Interaction:** Ensure the frontend client (`apiClient.ts`) is configured correctly to make POST requests to the backend. Refer to `docs/front-end-architecture.md#api-interaction-layer` for client/service structure and error handling.
* **Data Models:** Adhere strictly to the `User` entity schema and `users` table definition provided in `docs/architecture.md#data-models`.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling on both frontend and backend to prevent sensitive information disclosure, as per `docs/architecture.md#error-handling-strategy`.
## Story Progress Notes
### Agent Model Used: Benjamin "Beacon" Hayes (Product Owner)
### Completion Notes List
* This story establishes the core user account creation mechanism.
* Secure password handling and basic user data storage are key focuses.
* Sets up for subsequent login and subscription processes.
