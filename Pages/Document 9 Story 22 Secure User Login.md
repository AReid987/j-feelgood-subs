## Document 9: Story 2.2: Secure User Login

```text
# Story 2.2: Secure User Login
## Status: Draft
## Story
* As a registered user,
* I want to securely log in to my account,
* so that I can access my subscription details.
## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)
* A secure login form is available on the landing page or a dedicated login route.
* The login form collects email and password.
* Users can successfully log in with valid credentials.
* Incorrect login attempts are handled gracefully with appropriate error messages (e.g., "Invalid credentials").
* User session is managed securely using JWT tokens.
* Upon successful login, the user is authenticated and redirected to their Subscription Management Dashboard.
* The frontend uses the `POST /api/v1/auth/login` endpoint for user authentication.
* The frontend stores the received JWT token securely in memory (e.g., Zustand store) for subsequent authenticated API calls.
* The backend validates user credentials against the hashed passwords stored in the PostgreSQL database.
## Tasks / Subtasks
* [ ] Task 2.2.1: Create or enhance the login form component in the frontend (`frontend/src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.tsx`). (AC: 1, 2)
* [ ] Task 2.2.2: Implement client-side validation for login form inputs.
* [ ] Task 2.2.3: Integrate the frontend authentication service (`frontend/src/services/authService.ts`) to handle login requests. (AC: 7)
* [ ] Task 2.2.4: Implement the `POST /api/v1/auth/login` endpoint in the backend (`backend/src/api/auth.py`). (AC: 7)
    * [ ] Subtask 2.2.4.1: Retrieve user by email from the `users` table.
    * [ ] Subtask 2.2.4.2: Verify provided password against stored hash using `passlib`.
    * [ ] Subtask 2.2.4.3: Generate a JWT access token using `python-jose` upon successful authentication.
* [ ] Task 2.2.5: Handle successful login flow on the frontend: store JWT in state and redirect to `/dashboard`. (AC: 6, 8)
* [ ] Task 2.2.6: Implement error handling for invalid login attempts on both frontend and backend, displaying generic error messages to the user. (AC: 4)
* [ ] Task 2.2.7: Implement a global Axios interceptor in `apiClient.ts` to automatically attach the JWT token to outgoing authenticated requests. (AC: 8)
## Dev Technical Guidance
* **Frontend Form:** Reuse styling and structure conventions from the registration form. Ensure form submission is handled asynchronously.
* **Backend Authentication:** Leverage FastAPI's dependency injection for authenticating requests. Password verification should be performed using `passlib`.
* **JWT Handling:** Follow `docs/architecture.md#security-best-practices` regarding secure token storage (in-memory, avoid `localStorage`). Ensure token expiration and refresh considerations for future scalability.
* **API Interaction:** The frontend `apiClient.ts` should be robust enough to handle the token injection for all protected routes, as specified in `docs/front-end-architecture.md#api-interaction-layer`.
* **Error Handling:** Ensure that error messages do not leak sensitive backend information to the client, as outlined in `docs/architecture.md#error-handling-strategy`.
* **Redirection:** Implement the redirection logic using Next.js routing capabilities after successful login.
## Story Progress Notes
### Agent Model Used: Benjamin "Beacon" Hayes (Product Owner)
### Completion Notes List
* This story builds directly on the user registration by enabling existing users to access their accounts.
* Focuses on secure login and session management through JWTs.
* Sets up the mechanism for accessing protected resources and user-specific data.
