# Project Requirements Document (PRD) for JFeelgood Subscriptions

## Goal, Objective and Context

The objective of this project is to design and develop a compelling landing page for a monthly art print subscription service called "JFeelgood Subscriptions". This service will deliver trading card-sized "feelgood" art prints for $12/month. The landing page should effectively communicate the value proposition to potential subscribers, provide a seamless user experience for signing up, and allow users to manage their subscriptions.

## Functional Requirements (MVP)

### Landing Page Content

1. **Service Description:** Clearly describe the monthly subscription service and highlight the delivery of unique, collectible art trading cards. Emphasize the "feelgood" nature of the art to create a positive emotional connection with potential subscribers.

2. **Visuals:** Include high-quality images or examples of the art prints to be featured.

3. **Headline & Subheading:** The landing page should feature a headline like "Brighten Your Day with Our Monthly Art Print Subscription!" and a subheading such as "Get a new, collectible 'feelgood' art trading card delivered right to your doorstep every month for just $12!".

4. **Welcome Message:** Include a welcome message, e.g., "Welcome to [Service Name], your monthly dose of positivity and art. Our mission is to spread joy through high-quality, unique 'feelgood' art prints, carefully curated and delivered to your doorstep".

5. **Subscription Details Section:** Detail monthly delivery, art quality (high-resolution prints on premium cardstock), and the subscription fee ($12/month, cancel anytime).

6. **Call to Action (CTA) Buttons:** Include "Subscribe Now" and "Learn More" buttons.

### Authentication and Payment Processing

1. **Authentication System:** Implement a secure authentication system for users to sign up or log in and manage their subscriptions.

2. **Payment Processing System:** Integrate a reliable payment processing system that supports recurring monthly subscriptions of $12.

3. **Authentication and Payment Form:** Provide a secure form for sign-up/login and for entering payment details to start the subscription.

## Non Functional Requirements (MVP)

- **Responsiveness:** The landing page should be responsive and work well on various devices.

- **Security:** The authentication and payment systems must be secure.

- **Reliability:** The payment processing system must be reliable.

## User Interaction and Design Goals

The desired look and feel is one that is "feelgood," creating a positive emotional connection with potential subscribers. The landing page should provide a seamless user experience for signing up and managing subscriptions. The primary target devices are web desktop and mobile-first responsive web app, as implied by the need for responsiveness on "various devices".

## Technical Assumptions

- **Repository & Service Architecture:** The most efficient approach for this project, given the need for a landing page with authentication and payment processing, is likely a **Monorepo** structure. This would contain both the frontend (landing page) and backend services (authentication, payment processing) within a single repository. For the high-level service architecture, a **Monolith** for initial MVP with clear internal modularity, or **Serverless functions** for specific actions (like payment webhooks), would provide rapid deployment and scalability. The decision will be further detailed by the Architect.

- **Target Devices:** Primarily web desktop, with mobile-first responsive web app considerations.

- **Authentication System:** A secure system is required.

- **Payment Gateway:** A payment gateway supporting recurring payments is necessary.

- **Scalability:** While not explicitly stated with metrics, the phrase "expected traffic volume" and "scalability requirements" in open questions implies a need to consider scaling.

- **Design Preferences:** There may be specific design preferences or brand guidelines to follow.

### Testing requirements

- **Conversion Rate Tracking:** Track the conversion rate of visitors to subscribers.

- **Subscriber Retention Rate Monitoring:** Monitor the subscriber retention rate over time.

- **Customer Satisfaction Collection:** Collect customer satisfaction ratings regarding the quality of art prints and overall service experience.

- **Acceptance Criteria Verification:** The landing page is visually appealing and effectively communicates the service's value proposition. The authentication system is secure and allows users to manage their subscriptions. The payment processing system is reliable and supports recurring monthly subscriptions. The landing page is responsive and works well on various devices.

## [OPTIONAL: For Simplified PM-to-Development Workflow Only] Core Technical Decisions & Application Structure

### Technology Stack Selections

- **Primary Backend Language/Framework:** Given the need for rapid development and potential for future AI integrations, **Python with FastAPI** is a strong candidate for its performance, ease of use, and strong ecosystem for data/ML, or **Node.js with NestJS/Express** for a JavaScript-centric stack.

- **Primary Frontend Language/Framework (if applicable):** For a "bomb ass landing page," **TypeScript with React (Next.js)** is highly recommended due to its excellent performance characteristics (SSR, SSG), strong component-based architecture, and developer experience.

- **Database:** **PostgreSQL** for its reliability, relational integrity, and wide support, suitable for user accounts and subscription data.

- **Key Libraries/Services (Backend):**

    - Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.

    - ORM: SQLAlchemy (Python) or Prisma (Node.js/TypeScript) for database interaction.

    - Payment Processing: Stripe API for recurring payments due to its robustness and ease of integration.

- **Key Libraries/Services (Frontend, if applicable):**

    - UI Component Library: **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling combined with a headless UI library like **Radix UI** or **shadcn/ui** for accessible, unstyled components.

    - State Management: **Zustand** or **React Context API** for lighter-weight state management compared to Redux, suitable for a landing page and basic subscription management.

- **Deployment Platform/Environment:** **Vercel** for the Next.js frontend (provides easy deployments and CDN), and **AWS Lambda/ECS (containerized FastAPI/NestJS app)** for the backend for serverless scalability.

- **Version Control System:** Git with GitHub.

### Proposed Application Structure

The **Monorepo** structure is envisioned, hosting both frontend and backend code within a single repository to streamline development and deployment processes for a lean MVP.

```

- **Monorepo/Polyrepo:** Monorepo. This allows for easier code sharing between frontend and backend (e.g., shared types/interfaces) and streamlined CI/CD.

- **Key Modules/Components and Responsibilities:**

    - `frontend/`: Responsible for all user-facing UI, including the landing page, sign-up/login forms, and subscription management views.

    - `backend/`: Responsible for handling API requests, user authentication, secure payment processing with Stripe, and interacting with the database.

    - `docs/`: Centralized location for all project documentation.

    - `.github/`: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD.

- **Data Flow Overview (Conceptual):** User interacts with the `frontend` (Next.js) landing page. User input for sign-up/login/payment is sent via API calls from the `frontend` to the `backend` (FastAPI/NestJS). The `backend` processes authentication, interacts with the PostgreSQL database for user and subscription data, and communicates with the Stripe API for payment processing.

## Initial Architect Prompt

Based on our discussions and requirements analysis for JFeelgood Subscriptions, I've compiled the following technical guidance to inform your architecture analysis and decisions to kick off Architecture Creation Mode:

### Technical Infrastructure

- **Repository & Service Architecture Decision:** Monorepo with Next.js frontend and Python FastAPI backend services (or Node.js NestJS/Express) within the same repo.

- **Starter Project/Template:** None explicitly specified, but standard project setups for Next.js and FastAPI/NestJS are expected.

- **Hosting/Cloud Provider:** Vercel for frontend, AWS Lambda/ECS for backend.

- **Frontend Platform:** TypeScript with React (Next.js).

- **Backend Platform:** Python with FastAPI (or Node.js with NestJS/Express).

- **Database Requirements:** PostgreSQL.

### Technical Constraints

- Recurring monthly subscriptions of $12.

- Secure authentication system.

- Reliable payment processing system.

- Landing page must be responsive across devices.

### Deployment Considerations

- CI/CD requirements are implied for automated deployments, particularly with a monorepo setup.

- Environments: local, dev, staging, production are standard and expected.

### Local Development & Testing Requirements

- **Requirements for local development environment:** Easy setup for both frontend and backend within the monorepo.

- **Expectations for command-line testing capabilities:** Unit and integration tests should be runnable via CLI.

- **Needs for testing across different environments:** Ability to test changes in local, dev, and staging environments before production.

- **Utility scripts or tools that should be provided:** Scripts for starting dev servers, running tests, and building.

- **Any specific testability requirements for components:** Components should be designed for easy unit and integration testing.

### Other Technical Considerations

- **Security requirements with technical implications:** Focus on secure authentication, payment processing (e.g., PCI compliance if handling raw card data, though Stripe abstracts much of this), and prevention of common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF).

- **Scalability needs with architectural impact:** The ability to handle increasing visitor and subscriber volume, implying serverless or containerized backend services and scalable database.

- **Any other technical context the Architect should consider:** Integration with Stripe for payments.

- **Open Questions from PRD:** Are there existing authentication or payment processing systems that need to be integrated? What is the expected traffic volume, and are there any scalability requirements?
