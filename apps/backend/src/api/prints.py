    # TODO:
    # 1. Implement authentication/authorization to ensure the user is an active subscriber.
    #    - Use a dependency like get_current_subscriber.
    # 2. Implement authorization to check if the subscriber is authorized for this specific print_id.
    #    - This might involve checking database records linking users/subscriptions to prints.
    #    - If not authorized, raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Not authorized to download this print").

    # TODO:
    # 3. Implement logic to retrieve the file location (e.g., S3 key) based on print_id.
    #    - This likely involves querying your database for print metadata.
    # 4. Implement logic to generate a secure, temporary download URL (e.g., pre-signed S3 URL).
    #    - Use your cloud storage SDK (e.g., boto3 for AWS S3).
    # 5. Return the generated download URL in the response.
