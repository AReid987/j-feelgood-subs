# Story 2.1: Secure User Registration

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*   [ ] User can access a registration page.
*   [ ] User can submit registration details (e.g., email, password).
*   [ ] System validates user input (e.g., password strength, unique email).
*   [ ] Upon successful registration, a new user account is created in the database.
*   [ ] User receives confirmation of successful registration.
*   [ ] Password is securely stored (hashed).
*   [ ] Registration process is protected against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., CSRF, XSS).

## Tasks / Subtasks

*   [ ] Design and implement the registration form UI.
*   [ ] Create the backend API endpoint for user registration.
*   [ ] Implement input validation on both frontend and backend.
*   [ ] Implement password hashing.
*   [ ] Write database logic to create new user records.
*   [ ] Implement error handling for registration failures.
*   [ ] Add necessary security measures.
*   [ ] Write unit and integration tests for the registration flow.

## Dev Technical Guidance

*   Utilize the chosen backend framework (FastAPI) for the registration endpoint.
*   Implement password hashing using a secure algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
*   Follow the defined data model for user storage in the PostgreSQL database.
*   Implement appropriate status codes and error messages for API responses.
*   Ensure frontend validation provides immediate feedback to the user where possible.
*   Consult the Security Best Practices section in the Architecture Document for implementation details.
